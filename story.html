                        Alyssa</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. She
                        is the eldest daughter of David and Kuei-mei Huang and
                        the boss-sister for her four siblings. She has always
                        had the passion to serve the underserved and a
                        child-like sense of wonder for sciences and learning.
                        She has spent countless hours volunteering including
                        spending time with senior citizens with Alzheimer's and
                        volunteering at an orphanage in Thailand for children
                        with HIV. She received her BA in neuroscience and
                        psychology at Northwestern University (Go Cats!). She
                        ultimately merged her interests in science and helping
                        others by completing her medical degree at THE Ohio
                        State University. She currently resides in San Francisco
                        and is completing her fellowship in Pediatric
                        Endocrinology at University of California, San
                        Francisco. She enjoys teaching and has mentored a number
                        of medical students and residents.</p>

                        <p>When she is not at the hospital, Alyssa enjoys
                        running, reading, contemplating politics, traveling,
                        trying new foods, museum-hopping and spending time with
                        her family. She is known to be compassionate,
                        overly-optimistic and thoughtful.</p>

                        <p><span class="paragraph-heading">Timur</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; was born in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. He is the
                        son of Alfia Rakova and Alexander Alperovich. He
                        immigrated from Russia around the age of 14 and grew up
                        in Boston. He learned American customs through watching
                        countless hours of University of Iowa football with Ray,
                        his step father (Go Hawkeyes!). Moreover, he is a
                        die-hard Patriots fan and could watch Brady and the
                        Gronk for countless hours. Besides football, Timur has
                        always had a keen aptitude for computers. He even
                        started a small business fixing computers in his teen
                        years. He went on to complete a computer science AND
                        physics degrees (NERD) at the University of
                        Massachusetts Amherst. He too had a child-like sense of
                        wonder and went on to further advance his knowledge in
                        computer science in graduate school at the University of
                        Michigan. He ultimately moved to the
                        #SiliconValley and has worked at various start-ups.</p>

                        <p>Timur is an avid runner and recently qualified for
                        the Boston Marathon. In his spare time, Timur also likes to
                        tinker with his 1980 Kawasaki motorcycle, strategize for
                        his fantasy football team, and travel the world. Timur
                        is known to be very practical, thoughtful and witty.</p>

                        <p>Nothing but serendipity could describe how Alyssa and
                        Timur met.</p> 
                        
                        <p>To celebrate the completion of medical school, Alyssa
                        and a few friends took a whirlwind trip to Alaska and
                        San Francisco. Given her robust interest in science, she
                        and her friend, Hema, found themselves at the California
                        Academy of Science Night Life event. While wandering
                        through the live rain-forest, Timur first spotted Alyssa
                        eating a chao-shu bao and primarily wondered where he
                        too could get a bao to eat.</p> 
                        
                        <p>Later in the evening, Alyssa and Hema found themselves
                        standing in front of large dark window in the aquarium.
                        "Hmm, what are we even looking at?" Alyssa said without
                        any care. This is when Timur interjected, "Glow in the
                        dark fish!" Incredulous at who was trying to teach her
                        something, Alyssa turned around and found a handsome
                        young man in a suit. Timur and Alyssa clicked right
                        away. Hema was more skeptical though--thinking he may
                        have intentions of foul play in Golden Gate Park. But
                        her skepticism melted away as the night passed and
                        Timur's friendly demeanor and, more importantly,
                        ownership of a motorcycle came to light.</p>
                        
                        <p>Alyssa returned to the Midwest and Timur persistently
                        kept in touch. Alyssa eventually moved to Los Angeles
                        for her Pediatric Residency at University of Southern
                        California. Their friendship blossomed into a
                        relationship and ultimately into love.</p>
                        
                        <p>Though their relationship spanned Los Angeles and San
                        Francisco, they became very close. During this time,
                        they explored cities all over the world together,
                        survived 30 hour hospital calls, survived motorcycle
                        lessons for Alyssa, and drank tons of boba. After three
                        years, Alyssa completed her residency in Los Angeles and
                        decided to join Timur in the Fog City.</p>

                        <p>On one sunny Sunday, Alyssa was finishing up seeing
                        patients in the hospital. As per usual, she was starving
                        and borderline hangry.  Timur kindly offered to pick her
                        up on the motorcycle to get lunch together. Instead of
                        taking Alyssa to food, Timur led her to Tank Hill Park.
                        Alyssa (in a state of grump) and Timur climbed up the
                        hill together and were met by a mesmerizing view of San
                        Francisco that spanned from the Golden Gate Bridge to
                        the Bay Bridge.</p>

                        <p>Alyssa ran towards the edge of the hill and was
                        captivated by breathtaking view.  As she turned around
                        to share the spectacular view with Timur, she saw that
                        he had fallen down on one knee. With quick instinct,
                        Alyssa dashed over to resuscitate him. Timur then popped
                        out a wooden ring box. Many tears of joy later, Alyssa
                        and Timur were engaged. They held hands overlooking the
                        beautiful view of the city and the new adventure that
                        was ahead of them.</p>
