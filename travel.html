                        <p>There are two major airports close to San Francisco:

                        <ul style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
                            <li>San Francisco International Airport (SFO)</li>
                            <li>Oakland International Airport (OAK)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Both are served by the BART, as well as have
                        Cab/Uber/Lyft pick up areas. Depending on your arrival
                        time, the BART may be the fastest way to go, especially
                        if flying into Oakland as rush hour traffic across the
                        Oakland Bay Bridge can cause significant delays.

                        <h3>San Francisco Airport</h3>
                        <h4>Getting to the BART system</h4>
                        <p>From the San Francisco Airport, the BART station is
                        located at the Garage G stop on the AirTrain -- an
                        autonomous train going between terminals. Once you leave
                        the security area, look for the signs for the AirTrain
                        -- you will have to go up the escalator from arrivals
                        and across the bridge toward the parking garage. The
                        train is free and runs every 4 minutes or so. You can
                        take whichever train arrives first (Red or Blue), as
                        both stop at the BART station (the Blue train is a
                        little faster, especially if you are at Terminal 3).

                        <p>Once you disembark at Garage G/BART, there is an
                        automated ticket vending machine. It will issue a
                        prepaid ticket. If you're going to downtown San
                        Francisco -- Powell St, Montgomery St, or Embarcadero
                        stops -- the fare is $8.95. They have a <a
                        href="https://www.bart.gov/tickets/calculator">fare
                        calculator</a> to look it up ahead of time, as well.

                        <p>Make sure to <b>keep your BART ticket</b> (even if you
                        paid the exact amount), as you must insert the ticket to
                        exit the system and it will deduct the fare on exit.

                        <h4>Taxi/Lyft/Uber</h4>
                        <p>If you are going to use cabs in San Francisco, I find
                        the <a href="http://www.flywheel.com/">Flywheel</a> app
                        to be convenient for finding a cab. The far from the
                        airport to downtown should be somewhere between $50 and
                        $60. There are not enough taxis in San Francisco and
                        flagging one on the street can be difficult. There
                        should be a number of taxis at the airport, however.

                        <p>Uber and Lyft are also allowed to pick up at the
                        airport, at the departure level (conveniently, that's
                        where you find yourself on exit). Their fares fluctuate
                        on demand, but are usually cheaper than a cab.
