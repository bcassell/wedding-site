                        Timur and Jeff met at UMass (Amherst), where they were
                        both studying computer science. Their relationship
                        evolved from being bitter rivals while building
                        competing computer games (which involved players taking
                        turns and launching projectiles at each other's castles)
                        to great friends, as they both suffered through the
                        "wizard book".

                        Timur met David at the University of Michigan. The
                        trials and tribulations of graduate school, as well as
                        Timur's repeated (but failing) attempts to play flag or
                        touch football led to a common bond. Since then David
                        and Timur regularly discuss work, life, and various
                        restaurants in San Francisco in an ongoing facebook
                        messenger conversation that has started 5 years ago.

                        Mike and Timur also met at Michigan -- actually, during
                        the prospective graduate student dinner. Apparently,
                        Timur did not describe the program in the worst way and
                        Mike decided to join in the fall. Throughout their
                        overlapping years of grad school, Mike used Timur as
                        human Google Maps. They also played basketball every
                        weekend and Mike catalogued a significant collection of
                        awkward photos of graduate school shenanigans.

                        Ben was the other member of the weekend Michigan
                        basketball group. While we never met the first year of
                        graduate school, Ben and Timur got to know each other
                        while working on the Advanced Compilers project --
                        mostly while trying to complete the final project in the 2
                        days before the deadline. I, also, co-authored a paper
                        with Ben and co-started the weekly video game night
                        group.

                        I met Andrew during my interview at Maginatics -- the
                        first job out of grad school. I was so excited about my
                        interview afterward that I wrote everyone "Thank you"
                        notes and was hoping that they'd be happy to have me
                        join. Soon after starting, I found myself riding the
                        CalTrain with Andrew every night, at 6:35 (the last
                        bullet train to San Francisco).
