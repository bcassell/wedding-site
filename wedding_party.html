                        evolved from being bitter rivals while building
                        competing computer games (which involved players taking
                        turns and launching projectiles at each other's castles)

                        Alyssa met Barbara shortly after she was born. Alyssa
                        was instantly attracted to Barbara's shiny Buddha baby
                        head and glowing smile. They grew up together in Chicago
                        with the other siblings and caused a lot of mischief
                        together (just ask Mr. Huang!). Barbara is sassy,
                        goal-oriented and direct. She means business especially
                        when it comes to ice cream and pandas. You can commonly
                        find Barbara rooting for the NU Wildcats Football Team
                        with her fianc&#x00e9;, Dave (GO CATS)! Even though Barbara
                        lives hundreds of miles away in Chicago, she is still a
                        great influence on Alyssa's life and nothing can break

                        Timur met David at the University of Michigan. The

                        interests. Since then, David, Ben, Mike, and Timur
                        regularly discuss work, life, and anything else of
                        interest in an ongoing facebook messenger conversation

                        Cat joined Alyssa and Barbara a year later. She was so
                        cute with her pudgy cheeks that our uncle wanted to
                        adopt her! Cat is an optimist with a heart of gold. She
                        is currently residing in Tokyo and teaching English to
                        Japanese middle-school children. She spends her free
                        time volunteering with Tzu Chi (a Buddhist volunteer

                        Mike decided to join in the fall. It later turned out

                        They also played basketball every weekend and Mike
                        catalogued a significant collection of awkward photos of

                        engineering dorm. They instantly bonded over their love
                        of music and concerts. They have survived crazy mosh-pits
                        and even the "Double Wall of Death". On one occasion,
                        Shivani rescued Alyssa when her glasses were crushed at a
                        Thirty Seconds to Mars concert and helped her enjoy Jared
                        Leto's melodic voice.  Shivani has the brains of a
                        scientist and the heart of a punk rockstar. And her love
                        of cheese knows no bounds. After completing her medical
                        residency at NYU, she moved across the country to Los
                        Angeles, where Alyssa was completing her residency. They
                        were able to continue their adventures on the West Coast
                        -- including concerts, cafes, museums, and many
                        restaurant -week outings. Alyssa couldn't be happier to

                        They were "Sweet-mates" living in the same suite at
                        Slivka. They both shared a strong sense of commitment to
                        their education and spent evenings at Norris studying
                        together. After college, Ashley went on to complete a

                        and other "sweet-mates" went to visit her. Ashley and
                        Alyssa then flew to London to celebrate their 23rd
                        birthdays together. They walked throughout London,
                        watched the Phantom of the Opera and did a bit of
                        shopping at Harrods. Ashley went on to complete her MBA
                        at Stanford University (NBD) and now resides in the Bay

                        the interview afterward that he wrote everyone "Thank you"
